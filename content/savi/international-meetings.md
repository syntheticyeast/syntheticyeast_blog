With support from SAVI, we host an annual Synthetic Yeast Genome Meeting.  These meetings provide critical ‘face time’ for all researchers involved in the project to directly interact, in particular the students and postdocs who are the frontline ‘chromosome builders’. Additionally, these meeting attract members from the synthetic biology community, yeast research community, plus representatives from industry.  The yearly meeting provides an important opportunity to discuss downstream uses of the synthetic genome and collaborations with groups wishing to get involved in using Sc2.0 strains.
