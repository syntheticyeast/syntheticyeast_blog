S. cerevisiae is the organism of choice for these studies because the genomic and related resources that are available are, quite simply, better than for any other organism on the planet. There are eukaryotes with smaller genomes, to be sure, but the extent of knowledge about these species pales by comparison to S. cerevisiae. This offers the opportunity to bring to bear the extensive universe of yeast systems biology information to the design of chromosomes for the organism. Undoubtedly the synthetic yeast will differ from the native organism, and the multitude of genetic assays available for the organism can be used to understand any phenotypic differences that might be observed.
