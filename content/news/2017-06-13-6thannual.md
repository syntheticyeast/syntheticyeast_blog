The Synthetic Yeast Genome Project (Sc2.0) is the world’s first synthetic eukaryotic genome project that aims to create a novel, rationalized version of the genome of the yeast species Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In a truly global collaborative effort, research teams across the world have embarked on the challenging but exciting task of building 16 designer synthetic chromosomes encompassing ~ 12 million base pairs of DNA.

From 13-16 June 2017, international synthetic biology communities will convene in Singapore for SB7.0. The Seventh International Meeting for Synthetic Biology where several esteemed members of the Sc2.0 consortium will be speaking. The conference presents an opportune time for members of the Sc2.0 consortium to gather once again to discuss the progress on our concerted efforts on the Synthetic Yeast Genome Project and how we can lend support to one another to forge ahead towards finishing the world’s first synthetic eukaryotic genome together.

Location: National University of Singapore, Kent Ridge Guild House, 9 Kent Ridge Drive, 119241, Singapore
