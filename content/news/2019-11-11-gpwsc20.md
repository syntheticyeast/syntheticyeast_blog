Registration is now open for the 2019 GP-WRITE & 8TH ANNUAL SC2.0 MEETING
Hosted by the Institute for Systems Genetics at NYU Langone Health

November 11-14
REGISTER

Synthetic genomics is an emerging field driven by the rapidly decreasing cost of gene synthesis, scalable DNA assembly technologies, and the ever-increasing amount of genome sequence data. To date, convergence of these technologies has enabled total genome synthesis projects targeting viral, bacterial and yeast genomes.

This meeting will bring together global leaders in the field of genome writing, focusing on achievements to date, and more importantly, what’s coming up next.  Major topics will include whole genome engineering efforts via bottom-up design and total synthesis, as well as top down, massively parallelized genome editing by designer nucleases.

The Genome Project-write (GP-write) is an open, international research project led by a multi-disciplinary group of scientific leaders who will oversee a reduction in the costs of engineering and testing large genomes in cell lines more than 1,000-fold within ten years.

The Synthetic Yeast Genome Project, Sc2.0, is an international and collaborative effort aiming to design and build the 16 synthetic chromosomes of the world’s first designer eukaryotic cell.
