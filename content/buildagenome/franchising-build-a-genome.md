# Franchising Build a Genome

The Build-A-Genome course has been franchised at multiple institutions. In the
United States, B-A-G is taught at Loyola University (Baltimore, MD)
and Hartwick College, 
and courses are being planned at North Carolina State University. 
In China, Tianjin University has used the B-A-G China course to build
synthetic DNA corresponding 
to chromosomes syn5 and syn10.

If you are interested in leading a B-A-G course, the [BAG
Network](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/bag/) can provide information.
