# Franchising Build a Genome

Franchises of the Build-A-Genome course are now operational. In the United States, B-A-G is taught at Loyola University (Baltimore, MD) and courses are being planned at North Crolina State University and Hartwick College.  In China, Tianjin University has used the B-A-G China course to build synthetic DNA corresponding to chromosomes syn5 and syn10.

If you are interested in discussing a franchise, please contact Dr. Karen Zeller kzeller<AT>;jhmi.edu
