The Sc2.0 project has inspired related technologies and projects, many
directly generated by Sc2.0 activities.

* Synthetic Chromosome Recombination and Modification by LoxP-mediated
  Evolution --
  [SCRaMbLE](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/26/1/36.full) -- using
  Sc2.0 to generate and explore combinatorial genome diversity
* [The Dark Matter Project](https://www.thedarkmatterproject.org)
  using synthetic biology to understand regulatory genomics and
  non-protein-coding DNA
* Science Across Virtual Institutes -- [SAVI]({{<  ref
  "/content/savi/_index.md" >}}) -- an NSF initiative for
  international collaborations
* Genome Project Write --
  [GP-write](https://engineeringbiologycenter.org) -- extending the
  concepts of Sc2.0 to mammalian genome writing
* The [BAG
Network](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/bag/) teaching the next
generation of synthetic biologists how to build a genome
